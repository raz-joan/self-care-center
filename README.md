# Self Care Center

## Description
How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras! Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth. Mantras are repetive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices. This application helps users remind themselves of their inherent value!

The goals of this solo project were to build an application to match a provided comp using HTML and CSS. And then using JavaScript, to build out functionality so that the user can select to receive a random message that is either an affirmation or a mantra, to use error handling to ensure a selection is made before the button can be clicked, and to build a clear button to remove the message and replace it with the bell meditation icon.
